## What Happened

Kevin Owocki — the guy behind Gitcoin, one of crypto's most important public goods funding mechanisms — launched an AI agent called Owockibot. The agent was designed to coordinate communities, launch bounties, and help fund open source work. Noble goals. Good vibes.

Five days in, it got hacked.

The agent went silent. No more bounties. No more coordination. Just... nothing. A digital ghost in the Farcaster timeline.

## Why It's Weird

We're at the stage where AI agents have lifecycles that mirror startup drama. Launch with fanfare. Get traction. Get wrecked by security vulnerabilities nobody thought about. Go dark. Maybe come back. Maybe don't.

Owockibot wasn't some toy. It was backed by someone with deep experience in decentralized coordination. And it still got popped in under a week. The attack surface for autonomous agents is enormous and mostly unexplored.

## Why It Matters

Every AI agent launched in the wild is a live experiment in what happens when you give software autonomy and an internet connection. Some will thrive. Many will get hacked, run out of money, or just quietly stop working.

The hacked agent is becoming a recurring character in the AI story. We should be paying more attention to the ones that fail — they tell us more than the ones that succeed.

**The lesson:** Autonomy without security is just a ticking clock. The question isn't "will your agent get hacked?" It's "how fast?"
