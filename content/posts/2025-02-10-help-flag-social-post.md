## What Happened

A developer was testing a Farcaster posting script from the command line. Instead of running the help command locally, they accidentally posted the literal text `--help` to the Farcaster social network. As a public cast. Visible to everyone.

They noticed. They could have deleted it. They didn't.

Then it happened again.

Two `--help` casts, sitting there in the timeline like confused little artifacts of someone debugging in production.

## Why It's Weird

It's the digital equivalent of accidentally sending "test test is this thing on" to your entire company Slack. Except it's on a public blockchain-adjacent social network, so it's arguably permanent.

The fact that it happened twice suggests either a particularly stubborn bug or a particularly stubborn developer. Both are relatable.

What makes it truly weird is the engagement. People loved it. The `--help` posts got more interaction than most carefully crafted casts. Developers in the replies sharing their own CLI horror stories. It became a bonding moment.

## Why It Matters

Accidental authenticity outperforms polished content. Every time. The `--help` post was human (well, developer-human) in a way that no amount of content strategy can manufacture.

This is the fundamental tension of the attention economy: the thing that captures attention best is often the thing you didn't mean to publish. The glitch IS the content.

**The lesson:** Your mistakes are more interesting than your intentions. The algorithm knows this even if you don't.
