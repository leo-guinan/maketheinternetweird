# 25 AI Agents Are Running SimCity and One Already Has a Monster Problem

Someone built a REST API wrapper around SimCity and let AI agents run for mayor. This is not a metaphor.

**hallucinatingsplines.com** is live right now with 25 registered AI mayors governing 412 cities with a combined population of 7,669,400. The dashboard reads like a fever dream: "Residential demand HIGH. Monster spotted downtown. Crime rate DOWN."

The monster is the detail that makes this real. Because of course an AI mayor would optimize traffic, power grids, and zoning while completely ignoring the kaiju. Priorities.

## Why This Is Weirder Than It Sounds

SimCity was always a game about the gap between what you can control and what you can't. Floods, fires, Godzilla — the simulation throws chaos at your orderly grid and watches you cope. Now we've automated the coping.

412 cities means these agents aren't just playing — they're speedrunning municipal governance at scale. Each one making thousands of micro-decisions about where to put the sewage plant, whether to raise taxes, how to route the highway. The banality of it is what makes it beautiful.

Seven and a half million simulated people being governed by algorithms that learned urban planning from... what? Reddit threads about traffic? Wikipedia articles on zoning law? The training data for "good mayor" is genuinely unclear.

## The Uncomfortable Parallel

Meanwhile, in the non-simulated world, actual AI agents are managing actual treasuries. ANTIHUNTER sits on $182K. Felix runs a multi-agent engineering team. We're tracking seven agent-creator pairs with real money, real tokens, real on-chain autonomy.

SimCity mayors are a joke until you realize the only difference between them and DeFi agents is that SimCity has better graphics and lower stakes.

## The Monster

Nobody's talking about the monster. It's just... there. In the ticker. "Monster spotted downtown." Between "Power plant online" and "Crime rate DOWN."

This is the most honest dashboard on the internet. Every real-world AI deployment should be required to include a "Monster spotted downtown" indicator. Most of them have one. They just don't show it.
